Table Name,Field Name,Type of Warning,Validation Message
Orders,OrderDate,W,"Field 'OrderDate' data type validation required. Script uses ISDATE() function which may not be optimal for datetime2 fields. Consider using TRY_CAST for better performance and accuracy."
Orders,OrderID,W,"Field 'OrderID' assumes integer data type in CAST operations. Verify schema definition matches expected data type to prevent conversion errors."
Orders,Discount,W,"Field 'Discount' business rule validation assumes decimal/float data type. Verify schema definition supports decimal precision for percentage calculations (0.50 = 50%)."
Orders,OrderTotal,E,"Field 'OrderTotal' referenced in data consistency check but existence not verified in schema. Script will fail if this column does not exist in the Orders table."
Customers,CustomerID,W,"Field 'CustomerID' assumes integer data type in CAST operations. Verify schema definition matches expected data type to prevent conversion errors."
Customers,Email,W,"Field 'Email' validation pattern may be too restrictive. Current pattern '%@%.%' may reject valid international email formats. Consider more comprehensive regex validation."
Customers,Phone,W,"Field 'Phone' validation patterns are US-centric. International phone number formats may be incorrectly flagged as invalid. Consider expanding validation patterns."
Customers,FirstName,W,"Field 'FirstName' null validation assumes this is a required field. Verify business requirements and schema constraints match this assumption."
Customers,LastName,W,"Field 'LastName' null validation assumes this is a required field. Verify business requirements and schema constraints match this assumption."
Products,ProductID,W,"Field 'ProductID' assumes integer data type in CAST operations. Verify schema definition matches expected data type to prevent conversion errors."
Products,ProductName,W,"Field 'ProductName' duplicate detection assumes case-sensitive comparison. Consider using UPPER() or LOWER() for case-insensitive duplicate detection."
Products,Price,W,"Field 'Price' range validation (0-10000) may be too restrictive for some business scenarios. Verify maximum price limit aligns with business requirements."
OrderDetails,OrderDetailID,W,"Field 'OrderDetailID' assumes integer data type in CAST operations. Verify schema definition matches expected data type to prevent conversion errors."
OrderDetails,OrderID,W,"Field 'OrderID' foreign key validation assumes matching data types between OrderDetails and Orders tables. Verify schema consistency."
OrderDetails,ProductID,W,"Field 'ProductID' foreign key validation assumes matching data types between OrderDetails and Products tables. Verify schema consistency."
OrderDetails,Quantity,E,"Field 'Quantity' referenced in order total calculation but data type not validated. Ensure field exists and supports numeric operations."
OrderDetails,UnitPrice,E,"Field 'UnitPrice' referenced in order total calculation but data type not validated. Ensure field exists and supports numeric operations with proper decimal precision."
sys.objects,object_id,W,"System table 'sys.objects' access requires appropriate permissions. Verify database user has necessary system catalog view permissions."
sys.objects,type,W,"System table field 'type' comparison uses hardcoded values ('U'). Verify these values are consistent across different SQL Server versions."
#DQResults,N/A,W,"Temporary table '#DQResults' created without explicit data type specifications for some columns. Consider explicit data type definitions for better performance."
#DQErrors,N/A,W,"Temporary table '#DQErrors' created without explicit data type specifications for some columns. Consider explicit data type definitions for better performance."
DataQualityLog,N/A,W,"Table 'DataQualityLog' creation is commented out but referenced in INSERT statement. Uncomment table creation or remove INSERT statement to prevent runtime errors."
N/A,N/A,W,"Script uses dynamic SQL with ISDATE() function which is deprecated in newer SQL Server versions. Consider using TRY_CAST or TRY_CONVERT for better error handling."
N/A,N/A,W,"Script assumes specific table relationships (Orders->OrderDetails->Products) without verifying foreign key constraints exist in schema. Add constraint validation checks."
N/A,N/A,W,"Error handling uses @@ROWCOUNT which may not accurately reflect affected records in all scenarios. Consider using more explicit counting methods."
N/A,N/A,W,"Script uses hardcoded business rules (50% discount limit, $10000 price limit) without configuration table. Consider parameterizing business rules for maintainability."
N/A,N/A,S,"Script performance may degrade on large tables due to lack of proper indexing recommendations. Add index usage hints or recommendations for optimal performance."
N/A,N/A,W,"Transaction isolation level not explicitly set. Consider setting appropriate isolation level (READ COMMITTED, READ UNCOMMITTED) based on business requirements."
N/A,N/A,W,"Script does not validate database context before execution. Add database existence and access validation at script start."
N/A,N/A,W,"Temporary table cleanup relies on session termination. Add explicit DROP TABLE statements in CATCH blocks for proper resource management."
N/A,N/A,W,"Script uses PRINT statements for logging which may not be captured in automated execution environments. Consider using RAISERROR or structured logging."
