## Implementation Notes
1. All rules are based on industry best practices for survey-based compensation datasets
2. Rules prioritize data integrity, consistency, and usability for compensation benchmarking
3. Cross-field validation rules help identify complex data quality issues
4. Statistical outlier detection should be implemented with configurable thresholds
5. Reference tables (Dim_Countries, Dim_Industries) must be maintained and updated regularly

## Recommendations
1. Implement rules in order of criticality: Completeness → Format → Range → Consistency
2. Establish data quality monitoring dashboards for ongoing surveillance
3. Create data quality scorecards for survey data providers
4. Implement automated data quality reporting for each survey cycle
5. Establish data quality thresholds and escalation procedures for rule violations
