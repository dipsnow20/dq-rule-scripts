# Comprehensive Data Quality Rules for Compensation Survey Data

## Row-by-Row Analysis and Enhanced DQ Framework

This document provides a comprehensive, row-by-row analysis of survey data elements with corresponding data quality rules. Each rule has been systematically analyzed and enhanced based on industry best practices for compensation benchmarking.

| Data Category | Entity | Element Name | Data Quality Rule Name | Data Quality Rule Description | Remarks |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Compensation | SurveyData | BaseSalary | Check for Null Base Salary | Base Salary must have a value and cannot be NULL for active employees. This is a critical field for compensation analysis. | Industry best practice - Base salary is fundamental to all compensation analysis and cannot be missing. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | BaseSalary | Check for Zero or Negative Base Salary | Base Salary must be a positive number greater than zero. A salary of 0 is invalid for an active employee. | Business logic validation - Ensures data integrity for compensation calculations. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | BaseSalary | Check for Outlier Base Salary | Base Salary should fall within a reasonable range for the given Job Level, Country, and Industry using statistical thresholds (e.g., +/- 3 standard deviations from the mean). | Statistical validation - Identifies potential data entry errors such as $10 vs $100,000 or currency conversion issues. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | Bonus | Check for Negative Bonus | Bonus amount cannot be a negative number. A bonus can be 0 if no bonus was paid, but cannot be negative. | Business logic validation - Negative bonuses are not valid in compensation structures. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | Bonus | Check for Unusually High Bonus | Bonus should not exceed a defined multiple of the Base Salary (e.g., 3x) to flag potential outliers for review. | Business rule validation - Helps identify data quality issues while allowing for legitimate high-bonus roles like sales. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | Bonus | Check for Null Bonus | Bonus field should contain a value (0 if no bonus was paid) rather than NULL to distinguish between missing data and zero bonus. | Data completeness rule - NULL values may indicate missing data collection rather than no bonus paid. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | Currency | Validate Currency Code | The currency code must exist in the ISO 4217 standard reference table and be a valid 3-letter code (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP). | Referential integrity - Ensures standardized currency codes for accurate cross-currency analysis. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | Currency | Check for Null Currency | Currency code must not be NULL when compensation data is present. | Data completeness rule - Compensation data is meaningless without currency context. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | Currency | Check for Currency/Country Mismatch | The currency used should align with the official currency of the specified country, flagging exceptions for review. | Cross-field validation - Identifies potential data entry errors while allowing for multinational company exceptions. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | PayFrequency | Check for Null Pay Frequency | Pay Frequency must not be NULL as it is critical for annualizing salary data correctly. | Data completeness rule - Required for accurate compensation normalization and comparison. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | PayFrequency | Validate Pay Frequency | Pay Frequency must be one of the predefined values (e.g., 'Annual', 'Monthly', 'Bi-Weekly', 'Weekly'). | Domain validation - Ensures standardization for accurate salary calculations and comparisons. |
| Compensation | SurveyData | EquityValue | Check for Negative Equity Value | The value of stock/equity grants cannot be negative. Can be 0 or NULL if not applicable to the role. | Business logic validation - Negative equity values are not valid in compensation structures. |
| Demographics | SurveyData | CountryCode | Validate Country Code | The country code must exist in the ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 or Alpha-3 standard reference table. | Referential integrity - Ensures valid, standardized country codes for geographic analysis. |
| Demographics | SurveyData | CountryCode | Check for Null Country Code | Country Code must not be NULL as geographic location is essential for compensation modeling and benchmarking. | Data completeness rule - Geographic context is fundamental to compensation analysis. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | EmployeeID | Check for Null EmployeeID | EmployeeID must not be NULL as it serves as the primary key for identifying individual records. | Data integrity rule - Primary key constraint essential for data uniqueness and referential integrity. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | EmployeeID | Check for Duplicate EmployeeID | Each EmployeeID within a given survey snapshot must be unique to prevent data duplication and ensure accurate analysis. | Uniqueness constraint - Prevents double-counting in compensation analysis and maintains data integrity. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | EmployeeID | Validate EmployeeID Format | EmployeeID should follow a predefined format or pattern (e.g., numeric only, or 'E' followed by 6 digits) to ensure consistency. | Format validation - Enforces data entry standards and helps identify potential data quality issues. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | JobLevel | Check for Null Job Level | Job Level must not be NULL as it is a key driver in compensation analysis and benchmarking. | Data completeness rule - Job level is essential for peer group analysis and compensation modeling. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | JobLevel | Validate Job Level Range | Job Level must be within a predefined valid range (e.g., 1 to 15) based on organizational hierarchy definitions. | Range validation - Prevents invalid levels and ensures consistency with organizational structure. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | JobLevel | Check for Non-Numeric Job Level | Job Level should be a numeric value to enable proper sorting and analysis. | Data type validation - Catches text entries like 'Five' instead of 5 that would break analytical processes. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | HireDate | Check for Null Hire Date | Hire Date must not be NULL as tenure is often a factor in compensation analysis and career progression modeling. | Data completeness rule - Required for tenure-based analysis and compensation progression modeling. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | HireDate | Check for Future Hire Date | Hire Date cannot be in the future as this represents a logical impossibility and indicates data entry error. | Logical validation - Prevents impossible dates that would skew tenure calculations. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | HireDate | Check for Unrealistic Past Hire Date | Hire Date should not be before a reasonable company start date (e.g., 1980) to catch data entry errors like 1924 instead of 2024. | Range validation - Identifies obvious data entry errors in date fields. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | TerminationDate | Check for Future Termination Date | Termination Date cannot be in the future as this represents a logical impossibility. | Logical validation - Ensures data integrity for employment status tracking. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | TerminationDate | Validate Termination Date Logic | Termination Date, if not NULL, must be on or after the Hire Date to ensure logical consistency between employment dates. | Cross-field validation - Maintains logical relationship between employment start and end dates. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | JobFamily | Check for Null Job Family | Job Family must not be NULL as it is essential for comparing roles across different functional areas (e.g., Engineering vs. Sales). | Data completeness rule - Required for functional area analysis and role-based compensation benchmarking. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | JobFamily | Validate Job Family | Job Family must exist in the predefined list of job families to ensure referential integrity and standardization. | Referential integrity - Ensures consistent categorization for accurate cross-functional analysis. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | Industry | Check for Null Industry | Industry must not be NULL as it is critical for cross-industry compensation analysis and market positioning. | Data completeness rule - Industry context is essential for competitive compensation analysis. |
| Job Details | SurveyData | Industry | Validate Industry | Industry must exist in the predefined list of industries (e.g., NAICS codes) to ensure referential integrity and standardization. | Referential integrity - Ensures consistent industry classification for accurate benchmarking analysis. |
